Cross Validation 

Cross-Validation is used to estimate the test error associated with a model to evaluate its performance.
Validation set approach: 
This is the most basic approach. It simply involves randomly dividing the dataset into two parts: first a training set and second a validation set or hold-out set. The model is fit on the training set and the fitted model is used to make predictions on the validation set. 

k-fold cross-validation 

This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k folds of nearly equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set and the model is fit on the remaining folds. The procedure is then repeated k times, where a different group each time is treated as the validation set. 

Standard ML techniques such as Decision Tree and Logistic Regression have a bias towards the majority class, and they tend to ignore the minority class. They tend only to predict the majority class, hence, having major misclassification of the minority class in comparison with the majority class.

Clustering: Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group. Cluster analysis finds the commonalities between the data objects and categorizes them as per the presence and absence of those commonalities.

Association: An association rule is an unsupervised learning method which is used for finding the relationships between variables in the large database. It determines the set of items that occurs together in the dataset. Association rule makes marketing strategy more effective. Such as people who buy X item (suppose a bread) are also tend to purchase Y (Butter/Jam) item. A typical example of Association rule is Market Basket Analysis.
